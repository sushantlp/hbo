          Service, you acknowledge and agree that you will have to provide
          liveintech with your mobile phone number. You expressly acknowledge

          our protocols, or explore outside the boundaries of the normal
          requests made by liveintech clients. We have to disallow using request
          modification tools such as fiddler or whisker, or the like or any
          other such tools activities that are meant to explore or harm,
          penetrate or test the site. You must secure our permission before you
          measure, test, health check or otherwise monitor any network
          equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain. You agree not to
          collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including
          phone number, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems

          purposes. You agree not to spam, or solicit for commercial purposes,
          any users of the Service.
